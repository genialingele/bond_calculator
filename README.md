# bond_calculator
A calculator that helps you estimate how much your home loan will cost every month

This calculator is based on the South African currency (Rand), laws and variables. 
It is assumed that the user is not a VAT vendor 
Inaccuracies may occur due to the fact that every bank has its own conditions such as interest rate and initiation fee. 

The main inputs are
purchase_price : the amount agreed upon by you and the seller as property value
deposit amount: is the amount you have to pay as down payment. 
interest rate : this is the prime interest rate 
years: duration of the loan/bond. 

You can use the enter key on the input fields to run a calculation. 
You can reset the values as well.
